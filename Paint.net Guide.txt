1. Open up your weapon's mesh in NifSkope
2. Press G (disable grid), T (changes to top view) and Alt+T (disables textures)
3. Press the screenshot button in NifSkope, set the JPEG Quality to 100% and the image size to 1x and save the image to the NifSkope directory.
4. Go to your NifSkope folder\screenshots and open your screenshot
5. If it's a melee weapon, rotating it by -55° and flipping it horizontaly (go to Image -> Flip horizontal) seems the closest to the M.U.I. default (Ctrl+Shift+Z -> first field to 55°). If it's a gun, be sure that the barrel is facing the left (go to Image -> Flip horizontal if not)
6. Select your model with the magic wand (75%) and cut it (Ctrl+X)
7. Create a new image (File -> New...). Disable maintain aspect ratio and make it 252x96 (252 width x 96 height). Set the resolution to 100 pixels / inch.
8. Use the magic wand to delete (delete key) the white background and paste (Ctrl+V) your weapon into the new image (keep canvas size).
9. Resize your weapon until it fits your new image. If it's a sidearm / pistol / revolver / short firearm, try resizing it to 170x96 (170 width x 96 height) after resizing it to fit. If it's a longer firearm, try resizing it by X3s (93, 83, 73, 63, 53...)
10. Press Ctrl+Shift+T and adjust the brightness to 100 (this helps to get rid of any detail and make the image mostly white), press Ctrl+Shift+G (to get rid of any extra color), and press F4 to adjust the layers' opacity. Set it to 204 (80% of 255).
11. If your weapon is an "akimbo" (dual wield), place the second object of your weapon on the bottom left corner with a 52x52 size (see RX's icons and Millenia icons for examples)
12. Save your icon as a .dds file to textures/MUX/Weapon/Right with your weapon's editor ID as its name (save with BC2 compression, perceptual error metric and no cube maps or mip maps)
13. Mirror you icon horizontaly and save it to textures/MUX/Weapon/Left
